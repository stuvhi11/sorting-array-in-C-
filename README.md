# sorting array in CSharp  
Sorting an array means to arrange the elements in the array in a certain order.  

**Bubble Sort**  
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
